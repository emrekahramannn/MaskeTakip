# C# Microservice

During the pandemic period, I modelled the system infrastructure managed by the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Türkiye to meet the supply of masks from the necessary authorities for each citizen. Here, I used the MERNIS service to check whether the person is really a citizen of the Republic of Türkiye and according to the result from here (if the person is a citizen of the Republic of Türkiye), I ensured that the person can get a mask.
